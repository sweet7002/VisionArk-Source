                <p>Ever since the beginning of the electric guitar, pedals of some variation have been used. Pedals are still prevalent today, more than ever. We see pedals everywhere now, with bands such as Slowdive and Bloc Party relying on them heavily for their sound. Boss and TC Electronics have become pioneers of the pedal game. However, with multi-effects pedalboards on the market, why would you still use analogue?</p>
                <br>
                <p>It primarily comes down to preference. I’ve found that people tend to gravitate towards analogue pedals for more customization and controllability. This is especially apparent with shoegaze bands. It’s important that musicians have clear control over how their guitar sounds. This way, their songs can sound the way they were intended to, and analogue pedals fit that role really well.</p>
                <br>

                    <br>
                    <p> However, not everyone wants to use analogue pedals, which is why we’ve seen an increase in sales of multi-effects pedalboards, such as the Line 6 Helix, which I’ve seen countless times on stage this year.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>People may lean towards multi-effects due to the simplicity they provide. There’s not much risk with a multi-effects pedalboard, as they offer a lot right out of the box, which many people enjoy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Not only do they provide a majority of effects right out of the box, but they also offer them at an affordable rate. As they are all grouped together in a compact machine, the need for high-quality builds is minimised since it’s 50 pedals in one casing. This means you’re getting a much better deal for your money.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Now, you may be curious why I chose to gravitate towards a multi-effects pedalboard, and it comes down to several factors. Primarily, the cost. As someone who consistently performs live shows with my band, I needed something easy to set up and quick to get.
</p>
<br> 
<p>Not to mention, I’m not a massive pedalboard fan. I really enjoy having a pedalboard; however, the customization can be very overwhelming to musicians, including me. I’d much prefer to have pedals already there for me, which I can tweak if necessary. That’s exactly what this multi-effects pedalboard is.
</p>
<br>
<p>I’ve also fallen in love with the designs of multi-effects pedalboards, as they look very minimalistic yet pack quite the punch.</p>
<br>
<p>I’m curious, if you were a touring musician, would you pick up a multi-effects pedalboard or would you get a bunch of analogue gear? Let me know.</p>
