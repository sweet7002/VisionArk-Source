                <p>Recently, it was announced that WWDC24 will be taking place online via Apple.com on June 10th. This event will last from the 10th to the 14th, with select developers watching in person.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The event will take place at 10 am Pacific Standard Time. Previously, Apple has unveiled iOS versions at these events, as they are typically directed towards developers.

                <p>However, last year, Apple announced the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, along with the brand new 15” MacBook Air, which came out in a never-before-seen Midnight colorway. We also saw the release of a Mac Studio and a Mac Pro.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It’s speculated that this year Apple will release iOS 18, which is supposed to contain a needed UI update. People assume it’ll be similar to Android in the sense of controlability over the home screen; however, considering it’s Apple, we’re unsure if that’s the case. We will be uncertain until Apple releases iOS 18 themselves.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>It’s also suspected that Apple is planning to release numerous AI features with iOS 18. We believe this due to Apple purchasing Canadian software startup “DarwinAI”. It was also reported that Apple was in contact with Google regarding Gemini, which was previously titled Bard, which means we could see an upgrade in Siri, due to Google planning to switch from Google Assistant to Gemini on their Pixel devices.</p>
