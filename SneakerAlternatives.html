                <p>In previous years, sneakers such as the Air Force 1s, New Balance 550s, and Nike Dunks Low have been in the limelight, particularly in the summer. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>However, in 2024, that doesn’t appear to be the case. With Adidas Sambas and Adidas Campus sneakers taking the spotlight, it seems like this summer will be a classier one.
                </p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p> The price of the Adidas Sambas has increased immensely due to their popularity. Most notably, the English Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has become famous for wearing Sambas in photos.

                <br>
                <p> However, the sneakers can still be found for £75 and upwards. Due to the classier and monotone design of the Sambas, they are incredibly easy to style, especially because of the white colour.

                <br>
                <p> Another shoe that has been gathering attention in the past few years is the Timberland Premium 6. These shoes start at approximately £150 and maintain their price according to statistics. 
                    </p>
                <br>
                <p> They have become incredibly popular in the United Kingdom, especially since they provide a similar but more masculine design compared to UGG silhouettes.
