                <p>Nothing's first live and in-person community update took place in Japan just a few days ago. During this event, they spoke about the recent success of Phone (2a), discussed a slew of interesting concepts from the Nothing community, and the ongoing community edition project where Nothing fans can reimagine a new look for the Phone (2a). </p> <br> <p>However, the most exciting thing Nothing announced was a refresh of the iconic Nothing Ear and the introduction of Nothing Ear (a), a more budget friendly choice.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>While the Ear features an identical design to last year's predecessor, Ear (2), the Ear (a) is where all the change is at with its burst of bright yellow, compact design, and absence of wireless charging.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Delving deep, the two earbuds both have the same level of noise-cancelling, the same drivers, and even the same amount of microphones for crisp calls. There’s only one big difference that really changes the game, and that’s the chipset. The Ear features a stronger chipset compared to the Ear (a), allowing the Ear to have some incredible features. These features are an advanced Equaliser, allowing you to tune your music to exactly how you want to hear it, and a Personal Sound Profile, which tailors mic to how you hear.
                </p>
                <br>

                </div>
                <p>It’s not all negative for the Ear (a), as the weaker chipset equals a longer battery life. It reaches 42.5 hours with the case and noise cancelling off, while the Ear only reaches 40.5 hours.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Both earbuds have, what I think, the coolest feature: ChatGPT integration, allowing you to talk to the AI assistant with just your voice.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>With the Nothing Ear coming in at $150 and its small but mighty brother coming in at $99, will you be picking up anything from the Nothing Ear range?</p>
