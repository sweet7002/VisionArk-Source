                <p>In 2024, Gibson is recognized as one of the most respected guitar brands in the world, with a history spanning over 94 years. The first Gibson electric guitar was released in the 1930s. Nearly 9 decades later, what’s the appeal of buying a Gibson, especially with so many other brands offering similar options?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The answer largely comes down to the prestige and pricing of Gibsons. In the music scene, Gibsons were once known for being incredibly well-built guitars for the money. Over time, however, they have transitioned from being a good value to becoming a status symbol. This shift is reflected in Gibson's expensive guitar lineup, with prices starting in the low thousands and reaching into five-figure territory.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Gibsons have always been attractive, particularly the Gibson Les Paul, famously named after jazz guitarist Les Paul. Even with the Telecaster as a competitor when the Les Paul was released in the 1950s, the Les Paul remained at the top. This was due to Gibson’s promise of a solid mahogany body paired with high-quality neck construction, a significant upgrade compared to Fender’s bolt-on neck design.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Les Pauls have always excelled in sound, delivering a warm, rich tone that makes them ideal for jazz and blues music—the target audience for the guitar's initial release.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, despite Gibson's iconic status from the late 1930s through the 1950s, what has happened to them now? Why do fewer people play Gibsons today?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The primary issue is the price. It's not that guitarists don't appreciate the design and sound—Gibson’s lineup, especially the Les Paul, is impressive. But considering the price and the quality control issues in recent years, it’s not always a wise financial decision to buy one.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Over the past two decades, many guitar brands have branched out into making Les Paul replicas, such as Harley Benton, which is owned by online retailer Thomann, and Gear4Music. With prices ranging from £150 to £250, what makes a Gibson worth it?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Especially since these replicas aim to replicate the original Les Paul sound, something even Gibson is trying to achieve today, as most Gibson guitars attempt to mirror the tone of the late 1950s.</p>

                <p>
                    <p>Why would you want to buy a guitar that’s essentially doing what a budget guitar does but on a more expensive scale?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Personally, I’d opt for a third-party Les Paul if you’re considering one. They are much more affordable and offer a better value. For the same Les Paul design from Gibson, you’d pay thousands. However, a Harley Benton Alpine White Les Paul, for example, would only cost £145.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although the quality and feel of the guitar won’t be as premium as a Gibson, it comes close and offers a great option at an affordable price. The tone and overall sound are also remarkably similar. I’d argue that the Harley Benton Les Paul sounds better than an Epiphone Les Paul, which is concerning when you consider that Epiphone is a sub-brand of Gibson.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Not to mention, Harley Benton guitars have a higher standard for what makes a good guitar, which hasn’t always been the case. Thanks to Thomann’s extensive experience in selling guitars, they’ve maintained excellent quality control, unlike Gibson and Epiphone in recent years.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ultimately, it’s up to you. If you want to spend thousands on a Gibson, more power to you. But there are definitely more affordable options if you’re looking to take a different approach.</p>
