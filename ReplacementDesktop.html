                    </div>
                    <p>On the 5th of June, my custom-built desktop with a Ryzen 5 3600G and 1060 Ti ran into a few technical difficulties. These were primarily due to the drives and, overall, just poor maintenance on my part. As this was the first full desktop I’d built myself, there were a few problems that were waiting to bite me. This was only the beginning.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On one of my drives, Windows had corrupted itself. Rather than attempting to fix the corruption and buy another licence, I thought I’d switch to the dark side—Linux. I ended up picking Linux Mint as my first choice; however, I didn’t stick with it.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I found myself scratching my head and asking, “Is this it?” in response to Linux Mint. So, I switched to something a little more exciting in my eyes: ZorinOS. I had heard positive things about ZorinOS as it’s based on Ubuntu and heavily endorsed by Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="ZorinOS.png" alt="Image Sourced from Reddit" class="adjustable-image">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>ZorinOS was definitely the distribution for me at the time. However, as time progressed, I found myself wanting to do more with my computer. Previously, I stuck to programming and content consumption on that desktop. However, due to the specs, I thought I’d put it to better use.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>That said, ZorinOS’s gaming compatibility has declined significantly over the past few months. This is primarily due to Steam Proton not being as well-optimised as it could be, but also because Zorin itself just isn’t well-optimised—at least, not to a standard I’d consider acceptable.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I went from being able to run Grand Theft Auto and The Sims 4 on the highest settings with no problems whatsoever. Sure, it took its time to launch, but it worked. However, over time, that became less and less true.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Grand Theft Auto was the first game to break. The game became incredibly sluggish and unable to get past the loading screen, which is quite infuriating. There’s nothing worse than a broken game that you can’t leave.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="GrandTheftAuto.jpeg" alt="Image Sourced from Rockstar North" class="adjustable-image">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Sims 4 shortly followed the same pattern. This made me realise it wasn’t a hardware problem; it was an optimization issue with both Steam Proton and the distribution. So, I had to find a solution. As I’ve installed many distributions in the past, I assumed that it would be easy to install Windows again. However, that wasn’t the case at all.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For starters, I took the side off my case to unscrew my SSD, in order to prevent it from booting into ZorinOS, as it has a tendency to do so, even after entering the BIOS. This, in hindsight, was a bad decision.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>With a bit of research, I definitely could have found a way around this that would have left me with a functioning desktop. However, I was naïve and assumed it was the only solution. Rather than showing any boot screen or anything, I was left with no display output.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This leads me to believe that I either touched something while swapping out the M.2 SSD or something happened with the motherboard. What left me in a state of confusion was how the computer was still powered on, yet I got no display output and no response from ZorinOS or their companion app. (At this point, I had reinstalled the M.2 SSD).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I immediately suspected either display or motherboard issues. I switched my HDMI cable between my 1060 graphics card and the motherboard’s HDMI port, but neither provided a functional output. This led me to assume that it was a motherboard failure.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If the graphics card had failed, I’d expect the motherboard HDMI port to be functional, but it wasn’t. So, this has led me to build a new computer. I’ve been tempted to play The Sims 4 recently and have had to resort to playing it on my MacBook, which is less than ideal.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Let’s start off with what we’re buying and what we’re keeping. We’ll be keeping the CPU, RAM, SSD, and of course, the coolers. I recently came across the “GameMax Infinity Mid-Tower ATX” case, which attempts to replicate the well-known Lian Li 011 Dynamic style at a fraction of the price.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Coming from a relatively average-sized case, I think this one will look really good on my desk. It’s such a showcase PC, and as a gamer who’s spent too much money on RGB components, I think it’s a good decision.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="image-container">

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>For motherboards, I’m leaning towards the Gigabyte A520M S2H, as it’s only £82 on Amazon. Asus motherboards have been incredibly enjoyable to use, but they’ve been on a steady decline ever since I bought one, and I’ve only heard good things about Gigabyte.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As we’re salvaging the majority of the parts from my previous computer, this technically means the build falls under £250. However, in the future, we’ll be updating the storage and RAM to accommodate the intense video and audio work I’ll be doing for my coursework. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We’ll be going from 16GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR4 RAM to 32GB of DDR4 RAM, which will make a big difference as I tend to have a lot of tabs open when working on projects.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In terms of a new hard drive, we’ll be using the Seagate Barracuda HDD with 2 terabytes of storage. Over time (assuming that my experience with Seagate is positive), I’ll gradually add more storage to my desktop.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’m incredibly used to having close to 8 terabytes of storage on my device, so it’ll definitely be a new experience to have limited storage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’m so used to just downloading my entire Steam library, but as it has grown over the years, I doubt I’ll be able to accommodate all of it on my HDD. So, I’ll have to pick the things I like. In terms of other parts, we’ll be salvaging them from my previous build.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And well, that’s all for this build. This will be put together over the following months as we work on finding a solution to my now-dead computer. We’ll also be putting Windows 11 on this new desktop, which is a controversial move in my opinion, but the right one.
                    </p>
                    <br>
