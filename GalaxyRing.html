                <p>Samsung may not have a $4,000 AR headset yet, however they do have a new product category for 2024. The Galaxy Ring was announced in early 2024 with a release in July 24, 2024. It is priced at $399.99 which is higher then its competitors, however Samsung is justifying this price with its no subscription model.

                <br>
                <p>The ring features heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, gestures, and temperature sensors. The ring has a 6 to 7-day battery life, depending on the size, and is designed to wear 24/7 with it being water resistant to 100 meters. The Galaxy Ring seamlessly pairs with a Galaxy phone but can be paired to other Android devices, such as the Google Pixel, with only the gestures to dismiss alarms and control the camera missing. The Ring also works great with or without a Galaxy Watch. Pairing a Galaxy Watch means that Samsung will fuse the two device’s data together for increased accuracy and increased battery life.

                <br>
                <p>The Galaxy Ring comes in Titanium Gold, Silver, and Black weighing in at just a few grams. Samsung has $10 sizing kits available as the size is different from traditional ring sizing. The Ring is FSA and HSA eligible, and users can save up to $100 by trading in their old ring or smartwatch. Samsung has made it clear that there are no plans to introduce a subscription anytime soon, and all health data is encrypted with Knox.
