                <p>On the 8th of April, Dbrand customer and X (formerly Twitter) user @BhuwanChitransh posted a tweet with an attached image regarding discoloration in their skin after two months. This tweet was posted in hopes of aid from Dbrand, which was clear from the tone of the message: "@dbrand bought this skin a couple of months back. Couldn't even remain the same color after just 2 months. What should I do?"
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Dbrand replied to this tweet with "Your last name is basically sh*t rash, be serious," which made an inappropriate joke regarding Bhuwan’s surname. Although it’s typically within Dbrand's nature to tweet and reply in a joking and unserious manner, this was unexpected and inappropriate.
                </p>
                <br>

                </div>
                <p>After Dbrand tweeted their reply, Twitter users immediately rushed to the defence of Bhuwan Chitransh, calling this out as racism. Two days later, on the 10th of April, Dbrand issued a response and apology regarding the situation that occurred on the 8th.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The tweet was as sincere as it could be. They admitted their mistakes and privately apologised to Bhuwan Chitransh, while rewarding him with $10,000 to help with the situation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Brand ambassador and partner, Marques Brownlee, took to Twitter to share his concerns and perspective regarding the situation. In short, Marques stated how he would not be working with Dbrand until the tweet was deleted.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Dbrand replied to Brownlee, stating, “We left the offending tweet up because we didn't want to seem like we were sweeping this situation under the rug.”
