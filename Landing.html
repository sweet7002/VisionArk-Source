Create a landing page with Favicon.ico to the left with text saying "VisionArk is almost ready!. Sign up to be notified of the release" and add a type thingy where you 
can type in your email and then it's like a discord webhook and sends it to the discord webhook url of "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1256748699195801651/qleQhZuFN345fBwS1QY0C-KuQZ2re7hBcD0NPxZ3HTA55qwO8hy8W_4U1SefzgK5dfc4" and make it so the wallpaper is like discord dark theme wallpaper but with the poppins font
